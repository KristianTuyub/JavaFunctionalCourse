# Java Functional Course Notes And Code

###### Pure Functional Programming has a set of rules to follow:

- No state (there shouldn't be state around our functions)
- Pure Functions (shouldn't depend on global state or variable, and have to be self-contained)
- No side effects (shouldn't have a side effect outside the functions)

###### Higher order functions

Functions are considered if one of these conditions are met:

- The function takes one or more functions as parameters
- The function return another function as result
